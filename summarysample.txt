Mr. Jones has locked the chicken houses for the night but is too drunk to shut them up. The other animals arrive and begin to eat. Major tells them about his dream, which reminds him of an old song that he used to sing when he was little. He then begins to sing it again, this time using the words from the song he had heard on the farm many years ago. The animals are so excited that they start singing it right away. They even try to play it for themselves, but it ends up being interrupted by a roar from the barn. Everyone flees to their own sleeping place
