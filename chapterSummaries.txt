Chapter I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
    Alice is tired of sitting next to her sister and wishing she could do something with the book
    She sees a white rabbit running towards her, but it doesn't have any pictures or conversation in it
    The rabbit takes out a watch from its waistcoat pocket and runs after it
    It pops down a deep rabbit hole under the hedge that leads to a well
    Alice falls slowly through the well until she finds herself falling into a long hall filled with locked doors
    There are no locks on the hallway, so Alice wanders around wondering how she will ever get back up again
    She comes upon a three-legger table made of glass; there is only a golden key on it
    On the second time around, she finds a curtain behind which is a small door
    Inside, she discovers an empty bottle labeled "DRINK me" on it: this is not marked poison, but rather a kind of food for children who got burned by wild animals
-------------------------------------
Chapter II. The Pool of Tears
    Alice is now nine feet high and cries
    She rushes out to the garden, crying in pain
    The White Rabbit comes back with a set of gloves and a fan
    He drops the gloves and fan and runs away into the dark
    Alice begins fanning again, wondering who in the world she is
    She wonders if she is not Ada or Mabel, because she knows so much about them
    She says that she will have to go live in the house where they put their head down on the ground
    If she is Mabel then she will stay there until she is someone else
    When she realizes that she is two feet tall, she drops the fan and swims up to the seashore
    She thinks it might be a bathing machine, but when she sees a mouse splashing around in the water, she decides to speak to it
    She asks the mouse what its name is, and the mouse replies that it is a French Mouse from William's conqueror
-------------------------------------
Chapter III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
    The group of birds and animals are dripping from the water
    They decide to get dry by running a race, but Alice has no idea who is to win
    She hands out a prize for being the best
    The Dodo gives her a gimble, which she accepts as a token of friendship
    After the race ends, the Mouse tells Alice his story
    He says that Fury told a mouse that they should go to law so that he could prosecute him
    The mouse refuses, saying that it was too late
    An old Crab asks Alice about her pet cat, Dinah, and she replies that she wishes she had Dinah there
    When the party leaves, Alice begins to cry again
-------------------------------------
Chapter IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
    The White Rabbit returns to the house, looking for his gloves and fan
    Alice is frightened by the thought that Mary Ann will send her on messages for him
    She goes into a neatly decorated house with a bright plate bearing the name "W
    Rabbit" inscribed on it
    When she enters, she finds a small bottle with the words "DRINK me," which makes her grow larger
    After drinking half of the potion, she discovers her head pressing down against the ceiling
    She kneels down on the ground and then puts one arm out the window and one foot above the chimney
    As she grows larger, she realizes that she has no place to grow up
    She wonders what happened to her when she was reading fairy tales, but now she is in the middle
-------------------------------------
Chapter V. Advice from a Caterpillar
    Alice is a little confused by the whole thing, but she eventually gets used to it
    She starts eating the mushroom and shrinks down to her normal size
    The Pigeon comes running into her face and beats her violently
    He's not a serpent either, though--he's just a small girl
    Alice tells him that she's looking for eggs because she doesn't want to have them raw
    After some more nibbling, Alice returns to her usual size
-------------------------------------
Chapter VI. Pig and Pepper
    A footman comes out of the forest and raps loudly at Alice's door
    He produces a letter from the Queen, inviting her to play tennis with him
    The Frog Footman repeats this invitation in a very solemn voice
    Alice laughs at this so much that she has to run back inside for fear of hearing them
    When she gets back outside, the two footmen are sitting on the floor staring up into the night
    Alice knocks on the door, but the footman tells her that there is no use in doing such a thing
    She asks how she can get in, and the foot man says that he will sit here for days and then off
    After some time, the door opens and a plate slips out
    The footman continues his whistling until Alice finally enters the house
    It is full of smoke and fumes
    The cook is stirring a cauldron filled with soup
    There is too much pepper; the Duchesses is nursing a little baby
    The only other things in the room that don't sneze are the cook and an enormous cat who grins all over the place
    Alice asks why the cat grines like that
    The duchess replies that it is a "cheshire cat" and that they all can grin
    Alice does not like the way the conversation starts, so she decides to introduce another subject of conversation later
    While she is trying to fix one issue, the cook takes the caculdron of soup away from the fire and throws everything within her range at the Ducess and the child
    The Duchs sings a violent song about how to beat your little boy when he wants to eat pepper
    The baby howls as soon as it hears the words: "I speak severelyto your littleboy, And beat me when hysterical." Alice nurses the baby while singing a kind of nonsense song
    The infant grunts violently, and Alice thinks that it must have been sobbing because it looks so ugly
    As she nurses the baby, she notices that its eyes are getting smaller
    Alice realizes that the baby might be crying, but that it would make a nice pig
    She sets the baby down and feels relieved to watch it go home
    But before she leaves, she sees the Cheshirecat standing on
-------------------------------------
Chapter VII. A Mad Tea-Party
    A Mad Tea Party Alice and the March-Hare are having tea at a large table in front of their house
    There is no room, and they are all crowded around one corner of the table; there is nothing on the table but tea
    The March-hare asks Alice not to make "personal remarks," and she replies that it is very rude
    The first thing the Hatter says is, "Why is 'a ravenlike a writing desk?'" 
    He then tells Alice that she should learn notto make personal remarks because it is rude
    They begin talking about riddles, and Alice responds by saying that she thinks she can find out what the answer is
    She also adds that she likes what she gets is the same as 'I get what my like' 
    When the conversation drops off, the March Humble notices his watch, which has been missing for two days
    It turns out that it tells the date of the month and doesn'1t tell what time it is
    This makes Alice wonder why the watch does not tell her what day it is or what year it was
    The Hatters comment that Time is just an animal, and this confuses Alice even more
    After some discussion, Alice decides that perhaps she might do better with time than waste it asking riddle answers that have no meaning
    She suggests that she would rather spend her time learning music than trying to figure out how to use time
    In fact, she knows that she has to beat time whenever she learns music
    The Hare points out that when the Queen had woken up from her nap, she said that Mr
    Rigby wouldn1t do any of the things he asked him to do
    Since then, the clock always sets at six oclock, and so many tea dishes are placed out there
    The Dor Mouse comes up with a story: Three little sisters lived at the Bottom of a Well once upon a while
    One of the three sisters was named Elsie, lacie, and tillie, and lives at the bottom where treacle was found
    At the end of the story, however, the DormMouse begins to explain that these three sisters were living at the top of another well
    As the group moves on, the Marmee interrupts them, telling them to move one place onto
    The May Hare takes the position of the March
-------------------------------------
Chapter VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground
    Alice is curious to see the gardeners painting red roses, but they do not tell her why
    The Queen arrives with ten soldiers and courtiers carrying clubs and ornamented diamonds
    She asks Alice who she is, and Alice says that it is only "a pack of card games." The Queen turns furious and demands that the gardener's heads be cut off
    Three of the soldiers are left behind to execute them, so Alice puts them in a flowerpot near the Queen'S croquet ground
    The game is very difficult, as the players must double themselves up on their hands while standing on their feet
    There is a dispute between the Queen and the King about whether or not the Cheshire cat should be executed
    The King refuses, saying that he would rather not look at his head
    He calls for the executioner himself, but the Queen insists that the cat be removed
    Alice returns back to the Croquet Ground and finds a crowd gathering around the Cat
-------------------------------------
Chapter IX. The Mock Turtle's Story
    The Mock turtle's Story Alice is very glad to see the Duchesses again
    She tells her that she will not have pepper in her kitchen, but tries to find a new way to make things more pleasant
    The Duchessie asks Alice what moral she thinks of it, and she says that everything has a moral if only one can figure out it
    As they walk off together, the Queen warns Alice that she must either be off or face being executed by half an hour
    When they arrive at the Queen-owned croquet grounds, Alice does not even know what "a Mock" is
    The Queen then sends for a sleeping Gryphon to tell them about the history of the Turtle
-------------------------------------
Chapter X. The Lobster Quadrille
    The Lobster Quarille Alice asks the Grryphon what a "lootter quadrille" is
    The Gryphon tells her that it involves two lines of dancing, each with a different lobster as  partner
    The first figure is a snail who refuses to join the dance because he thinks it will be too far out into the sea
    The second figure is an eel who has his tails in his mouth and cannot join the Dance
    Then the Mock turtle says that they have to go with the fish to the dance so they can't get their tails out again
    He then adds that the shoes and boots are made with whiting hair
    This makes them look like snakes or eels
    After all, no wise fish would ever go anywhere without one of these creatures
    The Gyphon invites Alice to hear some of her adventures
    She begins by telling them her own stories from the time she first met the white rabbit
    They start by asking her to repeat something aloud, but when she gets up to begin, she realizes that there is nothing she can do
    The Mock-Turkle starts singing a song about Turtle Soup
    The gryphon wants to know if the song is really so kind, and Alice responds that it is not
    The Squire sings another song, this time about Turtle soup
-------------------------------------
Chapter XI. Who Stole the Tarts?
    Alice is in the courtroom with the King and Queen
    She looks at all of the things that are there, including the judge, the jury box, and the juror's slates
    The jurors are writing down their names on slates, which makes it difficult for Alice to remember them before the trial ends
    The White Rabbit tells the King that he has called the first witness-the Hatter
    The Hatter comes in with teacup and a small piece of bread and butter
    The King asks the Hatter to give his evidence, but when the Hatters refuses, the King threatens to have him executed
    He calls the next witness, the cook, who brings the pepper box into the court room
-------------------------------------
Chapter XII
    Alice jumps over the jury box and picks up all of the jurors
    The King says that the trial cannot proceed until all the jurmen are back to their proper places
    He tells Alice that he has no knowledge of the matter except for the Lizard who seems too overcome to move
    When the King asks what she knows about this business, Alice replies that it is very important
    The White rabbit interrupts and says that "unimportant" means "important." Some of the court members write it down as "important," while others write it as "nothing." The King then reads out his rule: "All persons more than a milehigh to leave the court." This makes everyone think that Alice is not nearly two miles high
    The Queen points out that the rule is the oldest rule ever in the book
    The white rabbit rushes off to fetch another paper from the prisoner
    It is a letter addressed to someone
    The Black Rabbit says that there is nothing written on its side
    The Knaute says that if the letters were written to him, they must have been written by someone else
    The Gray Rabbit adds that the writing was imitated by someone other than himself
    The Brown Rabbit continues to argue with the rest of the audience
    Finally, the King agrees to let the jury read the verses aloud
    They say that the poems told him that Alice had been to Mrs
    Hare and mentioned him to her
    She gave him a character but said he couldn't swim
    If she should try to push the matter further, what would become of them? I given her one,they gave him two; you gave us three Or more; they all returned from Mr
    Harle to you
    The Kings verdict is that Alice doesn't understand the meaning of the poem
    After the sentence is over, the Queen throws an ink stand at the Green Gables
    Alice protests that she does not care for her sister
    Her sister wakes her up and tells her that she has had a strange dream
    As she leaves, she imagines how little Alice herself will grow and how she will keep her simple heart
